#### Overview

In this lab, we will practice working with Amazon CloudWatch through the following tasks:

- Working with **Metrics** sent from sample applications running on pre-configured EC2 Instances.
- Viewing **Logs** also sent from these applications running on EC2 Instances, then creating **Metrics** from **Logs**.
- Creating Alarms from **Metrics**.
- Finally, adding Custom Metrics and Alarms to the CloudWatch Dashboard for better system monitoring.

This workshop is suitable for those who are interested in System Administration and want to start using CloudWatch to monitor a simple system, providing a more intuitive view of System Monitoring and Observation.
