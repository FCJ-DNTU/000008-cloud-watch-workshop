#### Overview

**Amazon CloudWatch** is a monitoring and management service that provides action-oriented data and information for AWS application and infrastructure resources, hybrid and on-premises applications. You can collect and access all performance and operational data in the form of logs and metrics in the same platform, instead of monitoring in silos (servers, networks, or databases). CloudWatch allows you to monitor end-to-end (applications, infrastructure, and services) and leverage alerts, logs, and event data to take action automatically and reduce average processing time (MTTR). This service helps you free up critical resources and focus on building applications and business value.

**CloudWatch** provides action-oriented information, assisting in optimizing application performance, managing resource usage, and understanding the overall health of the system. CloudWatch displays detailed log and metric data down to the second, maintains data for 15 months (metric) and enables calculations on metrics. It also helps you with analytics based on stale data to optimize costs and collect real-time information that optimizes application and infrastructure resources. You can use CloudWatch Container Insights to monitor, troubleshoot, and alert the applications and microservices contained in your containers. CloudWatch collects, aggregates, and summarizes compute usage (such as CPU, memory, disk, and network data) as well as diagnostic information (such as container restart failures) to help DevOps engineers Isolate and resolve problems quickly. Container Insights gives you insights from container management services such as Amazon ECS for Kubernetes (EKS), Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), AWS Fargate, and standalone Kubernetes (k8s).
