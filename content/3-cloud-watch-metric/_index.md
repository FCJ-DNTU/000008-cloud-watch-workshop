#### CloudWatch Metric

When working with CloudWatch, our main task is to "observe." CloudWatch provides intuitive charts and data tables to visualize Metrics. This is crucial as it reflects the health of the application/system we are operating, helping us make informed decisions on optimization and upgrades.

In this section, we will:

- Select the metrics we want to view (from the applications we set up earlier).
- Perform advanced Metric searches to display data in charts.
- Conduct advanced Metric calculations to show additional insights such as totals, averages, and rankings of Metrics.
- Create Dynamic Labels to make chart annotations more intuitive.

This section includes:

1. [Viewing Metrics](3.1-view-metrics)
2. [Search expressions](3.2-search-expression)
3. [Math expressions](3.3-math-expression)
4. [Dynamic Labels](3.4-dynamic-label)
