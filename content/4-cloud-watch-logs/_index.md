#### CloudWatch Logs

Logs are an essential part of any system, providing valuable insights such as:

- Application activities.
- Who performed what actions?
- Any errors occurring in the system?
- Any warnings that need attention?

In this section, we will cover some fundamental operations:

- Viewing logs.
- Creating logs and querying logs.
- Creating Log Filters and extracting Metrics from logs.

These operations will also be used in later sections, so make sure to go through this part carefully and thoroughly.
