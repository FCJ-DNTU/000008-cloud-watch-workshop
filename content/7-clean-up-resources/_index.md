#### Clean up resources

To clean up resources, you can simply go to the CloudFormation stack and delete the stack we created at the beginning of the tutorial. The Metrics and Logs will remain there for up to 15 months.

1. In the search bar:

   - Type `CloudFormation`.
   - Select **CloudFormation**.
